	<h4>Introduction</h4>
	<p>My name is Harry, welcome to my web page!  I have some information about myself listed on here so you can get to know me a little better!  
	I'm new to this whole web design thing, so I apologize if any of the formatting looks wonky, but we all start somewhere.  If you'd like to
	find out about information such as what hospital I was born in, what kind of sports I played in high school, my personal interests and hobbies, 
	my family life, or my current status as a student of UGA, please refer to my bio tab.  If you're interested in finding out about my plans for 
	the future, or other aspirations, refer to my future plans tab.  For any technical inquiries please contact us at 999-999-9999 and we'll be delighted 
	to assist with any Harry related inquiries.  I hope this page will provide a good representation of who I am and what I'm about. 
	</p>
	<h4>Bio</h4>
	<p>I was born March 16th 1998 in Macon Georgia at the Macon Medical center.  My mother is Maricha Fry a realitor from Waycross Georgia, and my father is 
	Scott Fry an architect from Columbus Ohio (I've included a picture of one of his most recent project in the link below).  I played Tennis all my life 
	and still love to play.  My personal interests include: watching football, watching basketball, watching baseball, volunteering with local charities, 
	participating on my fraternity's exec board, and spending time with my family.  I currently attend the university of Georgia and am in my second year.  
	I live on the east side of town very far away from campus, so I usually drive my car to school.  I am a brother of Lambda Chi Alpha, and currently serve 
	as a rush chair, which means I'm responsible for recruitment of possible new members.

	<h4>Future Plans</h4>
	<p>I plan on attending the University of Georgia as long as I possibly can.  Hopefully staying to get my law degree while remaining involved in my fraternity.  
	I would like to live in the south east preferably, but I would really go anywhere that I would be able to find a job pertaining to my major.  I am currently a 
	finance major but of course that is subject to change.  I want to have a family with two or three children and a dog, preferably living by a body of water.  
	I would like to work with hedge fund management or financial planning.  For retirement I would definitely like to live in either Macon or Savannah.  I still want
	to remain very involved in my fraternity as an alumni and possibly be on the alumni council.  My family grave plot is in Hazelhurst Georgia which is also where I 
	would one day like to be laid to rest.
